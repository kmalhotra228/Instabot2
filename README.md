# Instabot2
<h6> This project is the extension of my previous project Instabot where i have done insta scrapping through selenium.
  Now in this project i have scrapped some useful information like popular hashtags, popular pages,etc and plot the graph on the basis 
  of the data scrapped in a useful manner with the help of bar and pie graphs.</h6>
<h3> The tasks i have in this project are as follows:-</h3>
<h6>Now your friend has followed a lot of different food bloggers, he needs to analyse the habits of these bloggers.</h6>
<h6>From the list of instagram handles you obtained when you searched ‘food’ in previous project. Open the first 10 handles and find the top 5 which have the highest number of followers</h6>
<h6>Now Find the number of posts these handles have done in the previous 3 days.</h6>
<h6>Depict this information using a suitable graph.</h6>
<h6>Your friend also needs a list of hashtags that he should use in his posts.</h6>
<h6>Open the 5 handles you obtained in the last question, and scrape the content of the first 10 posts of each handle.</h6>
<h6>Prepare a list of all words used in all the scraped posts and calculate the frequency of each word.</h6>
<h6>Create a csv file with two columns : the word and its frequency</h6>
<h6>Now, find the hashtags that were most popular among these bloggers</h6>
<h6>Plot a Pie Chart of the top 5 hashtags obtained and the number of times they were used by these bloggers in the scraped posts.</h6>
<h6>You need to also calculate average followers : likes ratio for the obtained handles.</h6>
<h6>Followers : Likes ratio is calculated as follows:</h6>
<h6>Find out the likes of the top 10 posts of the 5 handles obtained earlier.</h6>
<h6>Calculate the average likes for a handle.</h6>
<h6>Divide the average likes obtained from the number of followers of the handle to get the average followers:like ratio of each handle.</h6>
<h6>Create a bar graph to depict the above obtained information.</h6>
